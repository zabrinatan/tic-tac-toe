# Project 0: Tic Tac Toe


This game does not need any installation. Here is [the access to the game]( https://zabrinatan.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

This project aims to create a functioning version of the infamous tic-tac-toe game.

My iteration of the game allows two players to play against each other. The first player is asked to choose the icon they'd like to be represented as and the second player's icon will be dependent on the first player's icon choice.

Project0: Tic-tac-toe has the functionality of recognising the end of the game and who won. In addition, it offers the players the option to play again at the end of the game. At this point, the game board is cleared and a new game begins.

Bonus functionality:
* A choice of the background theme upon selecting any of the theme buttons
* Icon choice selection is another functionality offered to the players
* The cursor is also designed to display the icon chosen by the players and switches as each person takes their turn.

Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery library
- Backstretch (jQuery plugin): stretches the background to the size of the screen.

Future improvements:
- Implement responsiveness on smaller screens
- Change alerts to on-screen popups
- Review code and make it DRYer
